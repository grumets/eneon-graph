Variations in temperature influence the formation of clouds and precipitation and the rates of chemical reactions, thereby influencing the hydrological and constituent cycles.

It plays a role in atmospheric chemistry. The presence of water vapour in the lower stratosphere, even though in small amounts, is radiatively significant. Here, there is potential for additional climate change feedbacks through changes in the processes that control the entry of water vapour through the cold tropical tropopause, changes in the upper stratospheric source due to CH4 oxidation and changes in the transporting Brewer–Dobson circulation",

Ozone is a harmful pollutant when present near the Earth’s surface. Ozone is also the most important radiatively active trace gas in the stratosphere and essentially determines the vertical temperature profile there. Ozone limits the amount of harmful UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Chemical depletion of stratospheric ozone, and ozone chemistry more generally from the surface to the mesosphere, are influenced by atmospheric temperature, by several of the species covered by the atmospheric-composition ECVs and by polar stratospheric clouds. Ozone is influenced by atmospheric dynamics, but in turn influences dynamics via radiative heating. Chemical depletion caused low springtime values of ozone to develop increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s over or near the South Pole (forming the so-called ozone hole)",

		"description": "Vegetation biomass is a crucial ecological variable for understanding the evolution and potential future changes of the climate system. Photosynthesis withdraws CO2 from the atmosphere and stores carbon in vegetation in an amount comparable to that of atmospheric carbon. Currently, biomass is a net sink of carbon with a net flux to the land of 2.6 ± 1.2 Pg C yr−1, partially offset by changes in the amount of biomass due to deforestation and other land-cover changes acting as a net source of carbon of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C yr−1 (values from IPCC, 2013). Thus, biomass changes provide a net sink of about 1.5 Pg C yr−1, which is equivalent to approximately 20 % of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Vegetation systems have the potential either to sequester more carbon in the future or to contribute as an even larger source. Depending on the quantity of biomass, vegetation cover can have a direct influence on local, regional and even global climate, particularly on air temperature and water vapour. Therefore, a global assessment of biomass and its dynamics is an essential input to climate models and mitigation and adaptation strategies. The non-climate applications of biomass information are legion, as forest biomass is a major source of energy and materials across the planet, as well as being related to issues such as biodiversity, water quality and soil erosion",

		"description": "The albedo of a land surface is the non-dimensional ratio of the radiation flux reflected by a (typically horizontal) surface in all directions and the incoming irradiance, which is the radiation flux from the upper hemisphere. This is technically known as the bihemispherical reflectance factor, and both fluxes must be relative to the same spectral range. For bare soils and other solid, convex objects, the material interface between the ground and the atmosphere constitutes the reference surface. In the case of vegetation, a reference surface is typically defined at or near the top of the canopy and must be specified explicitly. This “generic” albedo is highly variable in space and time as a result of changes in surface properties (snow deposition and melting, changes in soil moisture and vegetation cover and so on), as a function of fluctuations in the illumination conditions (solar angular position, atmospheric effects, cloud properties and so on) and with human activities (for example, clearing and planting forests, sowing and harvesting crops, burning rangeland and so on). Albedo is thus not an intrinsic surface property, but a joint property of the surface and the overlying atmosphere, since the latter’s composition (gases, clouds and aerosols) significantly affects the spectral and directional distribution of the irradiance",

Climate change is also projected to reduce raw water quality, posing risks to drinking water quality, even with conventional treatment. The availability of freshwater plays a crucial role in food production and food security. Irrigated land covers about 20 % of cropland but contributes about 40 % of total food production. Irrigated agriculture accounts for about 70 % of all freshwater consumption worldwide and more than 80 % in developing countries. Industrial use accounts for a further 20 % or so, and domestic use for a little over 10 %. Table 2 provides a breakdown by continent. Future food needs will require intensified production, including increased irrigation of agricultural crops and a likely rise in water consumption, which makes production more sensitive to drought. In order to obtain improved quantitative and qualitative information on irrigated land and available water resources, data on their spatial distribution and change over time are essential",

They also emit CH4, and are a major source of aerosols, CO and oxides of nitrogen, thus affecting local and regional air quality. Estimates of greenhouse gas emissions due to fires are essential for realistic modelling of climate and its critical component, the global carbon cycle. Fires caused deliberately for land clearance (agriculture and ranching) or accidentally (lightning strikes and human error) are a major factor in land-cover variability and change, and hence affect fluxes of energy and water to the atmosphere. Spatially and temporally resolved trace-gas and aerosol emissions from fires are the main target quantities.

		"description": "Solar radiation in the spectral range 400–700 nm, known as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), provides the energy required by terrestrial vegetation to produce organic materials from mineral components. The part of this PAR that is effectively absorbed by plants is called FAPAR. It is a non-dimensional quantity varying from 0 (over deserts) to 1 (for large, deep, homogeneous canopy layers observed by medium- to low-resolution sensors), although the maximum value is never witnessed in practice because some of the incoming light is always reflected back by the canopy or the underlying ground. FAPAR is related to, but different from, LAI (covered in the following subsection), which describes the amount of leaf material in the canopy. FAPAR plays a critical role in assessing the primary productivity of canopies, the associated fixation of atmospheric CO2 and the energy balance of the surface. As is the case with land-surface albedo (section 6.3.9), FAPAR depends on the illumination conditions, that is, the angular position of the Sun with respect to the vegetation layer and the relative contributions of the direct and diffuse irradiances. Both black-sky (assuming only direct radiation) and white-sky (assuming that all the incoming radiation is in the form of isotropic diffuse radiation) FAPAR values may be considered",

Global groundwater abstraction has at least tripled over the past 50 years, much more so in some regions, and is used mainly for agriculture. The relative increase in groundwater use over recent decades has been larger than that of surface-water use. Climate change affects groundwater recharge rates through changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. However, attributing observed groundwater change to climate change is difficult because of land-use change and groundwater abstraction, and the extent to which groundwater abstraction has already been affected by climate change is not known. Climate change can also affect groundwater through saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers as sea level rises. This can be observed by a change in the electrical conductivity of groundwater, but attribution is again complicated by abstraction, as withdrawal of freshwater from the ground may draw more-saline water into the aquifer",

This dimensionless variable (sometimes expressed in terms of square metres of leaf material per square metre of ground) varies between 0 and values of about 10 or so, depending on local conditions.

The INSPIRE directive aims to create a European Union (EU) spatial data infrastructure. This will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe. A European Spatial Data Infrastructure will assist in policy-making across boundaries. Therefore the spatial information considered under the directive is extensive and includes a great variety of topical and technical themes. INSPIRE is based on a number of common principles: (1) Data should be collected only once and kept where it can be maintained most effectively, (2) It should be possible to combine seamless spatial information from different sources across Europe and share it with many users and applications, (3) It should be possible for information collected at one level/scale to be shared with all levels/scales; detailed for thorough investigations, general for strategic purposes, (4) Geographic information needed for good governance at all levels should be readily and transparently available, (5) Easy to find what geographic information is available, how it can be used to meet a particular need, and under which conditions it can be acquired and used.",

Through communication issues, selection criteria and activities, several other researchers and scientists became involved from public Agencies, Universities and research Institutes they spread information about the initiative and searched for suitable research sites. Favourable conditions for the start up of the Network were available thanks to the international Project ALTER-Net (A Long–Term Biodiversity, Ecosystem and Awareness Research Network; www.alter-net.info) and the National Forest Service – Conecofor Office (Corpo Forestale dello Stato – Ufficio Conecofor), the Italian partner of the project.

The initial background work for SAON was done by the SAON Steering Group (SAON-SG), and with the first meeting of the Board in January 2012, SAON was formally established. Its purpose is to support and strengthen the development of multinational engagement for sustained and coordinated pan-Arctic observing and data sharing systems that serve societal needs, particularly related to environmental, social, economic and cultural issues. SAON promotes the vision of well-defined observing networks that enable users to have access to free, open and high quality data that will realize pan-Arctic and global value-added services and provide societal benefits. Its goal is to enhance Arctic-wide observing activities by facilitating partnerships and synergies among existing observing and data networks (“building blocks”), and promoting sharing and synthesis of data and information. SAON also is committed to facilitating the inclusion of Arctic indigenous people in observing activities, in particular by promoting community-based monitoring (CBM) efforts. SAON is maintaining information about Arctic observational networks, projects, programs, and platforms",
