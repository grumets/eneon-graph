RDF directly read in the browser

Based on: https://github.com/nylen/d3-process-map

2 issues changed:
1.- Links had no label, so only 2 type of relations could be possible: “depends” and “dependent on”. This change is taken from: https://github.com/Rathachai/d3rdf
2.- Introduced that “final” elements, which are strings, are not shown in the graph, but only in the results. This change is taken from: https://github.com/alangrafu/visualRDF
