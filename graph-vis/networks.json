Ozone is a harmful pollutant when present near the Earth’s surface. Ozone is also the most important radiatively active trace gas in the stratosphere and essentially determines the vertical temperature profile there. Ozone limits the amount of harmful UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Chemical depletion of stratospheric ozone, and ozone chemistry more generally from the surface to the mesosphere, are influenced by atmospheric temperature, by several of the species covered by the atmospheric-composition ECVs and by polar stratospheric clouds. Ozone is influenced by atmospheric dynamics, but in turn influences dynamics via radiative heating. Chemical depletion caused low springtime values of ozone to develop increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s over or near the South Pole (forming the so-called ozone hole)",

		"description": "Surface heat flux is exchange of heat, per unit area, crossing the surface between the ocean and the atmosphere.  It consists of the turbulent (latent and sensible) and the radiative (short wave and long wave) components.  These fluxes are major contributors to the energy and moisture budgets, and are largely responsible for thermodynamic coupling the ocean and atmosphere at global and regional scales, and variability of these fluxes is in part related to large-scale variability in weather (climate) patterns. For most regions, the two major components are the net shortwave gain by the ocean and the latent heat flux loss by the ocean. The net heat flux is generally considered to be the sum at the sea surface of the net shortwave or visible radiation, the net longwave or infrared radiation, the latent or evaporative heat flux, and the sensible heat flux.  In some cases, the cooling due to rainfall falling at the dew point temperature is also added.  Incoming shortwave and longwave radiation are measured by radiometers, with the reflected and outgoing components estimated by formulae.  Latent and sensible heat flux, like wind stress, can be measured directly by three-dimensional anemometry and fast response sensors that support the computation of the covariance between vertical velocity fluctuations in the wind and temperature (sensible) and humidity (latent) fluctuations.",

Ocean heat content directly derived from subsurface temperature is of paramount importance in the monitoring of the Earth’s climate system and marine environment. Many other physical variables are derived from subsurface temperature along with subsurface salinity, including subsurface density, geostrophic circulation, heat transport and steric sea level. These variables are essential to the understanding of variability and change in ocean stratification, circulation patterns (uptake and redistribution of heat and freshwater) and sea level. Heat uptake by the global ocean accounts for more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system in the past few decades. This ocean heat uptake helps to mitigate surface warming but, in turn, increases the global ocean volume through thermal expansion, and thus results in global-mean sea-level rise, accounting for about one third of the increase observed over the past few decades. Changes in subsurface temperature induce changes in mixed-layer depth, thermal/density stratification, mixing rates and currents. All of these physical changes can affect marine biology, not only directly but also indirectly through changes in marine biogeochemistry, such as nutrient and O2 recycling, uptake of carbon emissions, ocean acidification and so on.",

Motion on these scales also has a large impact on vertical circulation and mixing, and in turn on marine ecosystems and ocean productivity.

Because the net ocean carbon uptake depends on chemical and biological activity, the uptake may change as oceanic conditions change (e.g., pH, currents, temperature, surface winds, and biological productivity).

The ocean - including its coastal areas such as continental shelves, estuaries and upwelling areas - contribute about 30% to the atmospheric N2O budget. The amount of N2O produced during water column microbially mediated processes called nitrification and denitrification strongly depends on the prevailing dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations and is significantly enhanced under low (i.e. suboxic) O2 conditions. Thus, significantly enhanced N2O concentrations are generally found at oxic/suboxic or oxic/anoxic boundaries.

In a business-as-usual scenario, the ocean is projected to lose nearly 20% of its O2. This could have dramatic consequences for marine biogeochemistry and marine life, as the ocean’s O2 minimum zones will expand substantially, and large swaths of ocean will appear that have O2 levels that are too low for fast-swimming fish to survive, and can potentially reduce the pool of bioavailable nitrogen due to reduction of nitrate.",

Measurement of transient tracers in the subsurface ocean thus provides information on the time-scales since the ocean was ventilated, i.e. in contact with the atmosphere. A combination of these tracers provide the means to constrain the transit time distribution (TTD) of a water-mass that allows inference of concentrations or fates of other transient compounds, such as anthropogenic carbon or nitrous oxide. Commonly measured transient tracers are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 11 and 12. More recently also the related compound sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is regularly measured since it provides information on ventilation of the rapidly ventilated parts of the ocean.

		"description": "Vegetation biomass is a crucial ecological variable for understanding the evolution and potential future changes of the climate system. Photosynthesis withdraws CO2 from the atmosphere and stores carbon in vegetation in an amount comparable to that of atmospheric carbon. Currently, biomass is a net sink of carbon with a net flux to the land of 2.6 ± 1.2 Pg C yr−1, partially offset by changes in the amount of biomass due to deforestation and other land-cover changes acting as a net source of carbon of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C yr−1 (values from IPCC, 2013). Thus, biomass changes provide a net sink of about 1.5 Pg C yr−1, which is equivalent to approximately 20 % of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Vegetation systems have the potential either to sequester more carbon in the future or to contribute as an even larger source. Depending on the quantity of biomass, vegetation cover can have a direct influence on local, regional and even global climate, particularly on air temperature and water vapour. Therefore, a global assessment of biomass and its dynamics is an essential input to climate models and mitigation and adaptation strategies. The non-climate applications of biomass information are legion, as forest biomass is a major source of energy and materials across the planet, as well as being related to issues such as biodiversity, water quality and soil erosion",

		"description": "The albedo of a land surface is the non-dimensional ratio of the radiation flux reflected by a (typically horizontal) surface in all directions and the incoming irradiance, which is the radiation flux from the upper hemisphere. This is technically known as the bihemispherical reflectance factor, and both fluxes must be relative to the same spectral range. For bare soils and other solid, convex objects, the material interface between the ground and the atmosphere constitutes the reference surface. In the case of vegetation, a reference surface is typically defined at or near the top of the canopy and must be specified explicitly. This “generic” albedo is highly variable in space and time as a result of changes in surface properties (snow deposition and melting, changes in soil moisture and vegetation cover and so on), as a function of fluctuations in the illumination conditions (solar angular position, atmospheric effects, cloud properties and so on) and with human activities (for example, clearing and planting forests, sowing and harvesting crops, burning rangeland and so on). Albedo is thus not an intrinsic surface property, but a joint property of the surface and the overlying atmosphere, since the latter’s composition (gases, clouds and aerosols) significantly affects the spectral and directional distribution of the irradiance",

Climate Change is projected to reduce renewable surface-water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions. In contrast, water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes. Climate change is also projected to reduce raw water quality, posing risks to drinking water quality, even with conventional treatment. The availability of freshwater plays a crucial role in food production and food security. Irrigated land covers about 20 % of cropland but contributes about 40 % of total food production. Irrigated agriculture accounts for about 70 % of all freshwater consumption worldwide and more than 80 % in developing countries. Industrial use accounts for a further 20 % or so, and domestic use for a little over 10 %. Table 2 provides a breakdown by continent. Future food needs will require intensified production, including increased irrigation of agricultural crops and a likely rise in water consumption, which makes production more sensitive to drought. In order to obtain improved quantitative and qualitative information on irrigated land and available water resources, data on their spatial distribution and change over time are essential",

While they can be a natural part of many ecosystems, they contribute to the build-up of CO2 through deforestation fires, tropical peatland fires, and areas that see an increase in the fire return interval. They also emit CH4, and are a major source of aerosols, CO and oxides of nitrogen, thus affecting local and regional air quality. Estimates of greenhouse gas emissions due to fires are essential for realistic modelling of climate and its critical component, the global carbon cycle. Fires caused deliberately for land clearance (agriculture and ranching) or accidentally (lightning strikes and human error) are a major factor in land-cover variability and change, and hence affect fluxes of energy and water to the atmosphere. Spatially and temporally resolved trace-gas and aerosol emissions from fires are the main target quantities. These can be inferred using both land-surface and atmospheric measurements (section 4.7), preferably in combination",

		"description": "Solar radiation in the spectral range 400–700 nm, known as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), provides the energy required by terrestrial vegetation to produce organic materials from mineral components. The part of this PAR that is effectively absorbed by plants is called FAPAR. It is a non-dimensional quantity varying from 0 (over deserts) to 1 (for large, deep, homogeneous canopy layers observed by medium- to low-resolution sensors), although the maximum value is never witnessed in practice because some of the incoming light is always reflected back by the canopy or the underlying ground. FAPAR is related to, but different from, LAI (covered in the following subsection), which describes the amount of leaf material in the canopy. FAPAR plays a critical role in assessing the primary productivity of canopies, the associated fixation of atmospheric CO2 and the energy balance of the surface. As is the case with land-surface albedo (section 6.3.9), FAPAR depends on the illumination conditions, that is, the angular position of the Sun with respect to the vegetation layer and the relative contributions of the direct and diffuse irradiances. Both black-sky (assuming only direct radiation) and white-sky (assuming that all the incoming radiation is in the form of isotropic diffuse radiation) FAPAR values may be considered",

Global groundwater abstraction has at least tripled over the past 50 years, much more so in some regions, and is used mainly for agriculture. The relative increase in groundwater use over recent decades has been larger than that of surface-water use. Climate change affects groundwater recharge rates through changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. However, attributing observed groundwater change to climate change is difficult because of land-use change and groundwater abstraction, and the extent to which groundwater abstraction has already been affected by climate change is not known. Climate change can also affect groundwater through saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers as sea level rises. This can be observed by a change in the electrical conductivity of groundwater, but attribution is again complicated by abstraction, as withdrawal of freshwater from the ground may draw more-saline water into the aquifer",

On sloping surfaces, the leaf area should be projected to the underlying ground along the normal to the slope. This dimensionless variable (sometimes expressed in terms of square metres of leaf material per square metre of ground) varies between 0 and values of about 10 or so, depending on local conditions. It partly controls important mass and energy exchange processes, such as radiation and rain interception, as well as photosynthesis and respiration, which couple vegetation to the climate system.

		"description": "Sea Surface Height is one of the primary indicators of global climate change. Change in the global mean sea level provides a measure of the net change in ocean mass due to melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and net change in ocean volume due to thermal expansion. The rise of sea level over the past century is known from tide gauges to be around 1.7 +/- 0.4 mm/yr. Data acquired since 1991 from satellite radar altimeters have provided an uninterrupted view of sea level on a global scale, and reveal a global average trend estimated at 3.3 +/-0.5 mm/yr. Sea level observations characterize intra-seasonal variably such as ENSO, and the correlation between sea surface height (SSH) variability and underlying subsurface temperature anomalies can be exploited to derive analyses of the upper ocean heat content and derived products such as Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential. On the regional scales, changes in sea level can be far larger than the globally averaged value and result from several factors, including changes in temperature, salinity and circulation. At ocean basin scale, land uplift associated with mass redistributions due to past and current land ice melt also cause regional variations in sea level. Estimations of changes in coastal sea level, of extreme relevance for societal impacts, are under-sampled by the current altimeter. Coastal products are therefore usually improved with additional knowledge of winds and tides. In situ Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) water level gauges provide calibration and validation data to complement satellite observations, whilst GLOSS data themselves monitor multi-decadal trends in sea level rise and help reconcile the sea level signal associated with crustal displacements.",

On basin scales, surface currents and their variations are a major player in climate to weather fluctuations. Parameterized wind stress and heat flux depend upon the speed of the near-surface wind relative to the moving ocean surface, which can be significantly affected at large scales by surface currents such as the western boundary currents and Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and at smaller scales by mesoscale variability. Convergences/divergences, spiralling eddies, and filaments all contribute to vertical motions and mass exchange. Surface currents impact the steepness of surface waves, and are thus important for generating accurate marine sea state forecasts. Because of their significance in advecting passive particles, knowledge of surface currents is also important for applications such as oil spill and marine debris response, search and rescue operations, and ship routing.

The net heat flux is the sum of turbulent (latent and sensible) fluxes and the radiative (short wave and long wave) components. Oceanographic convention is that a positive flux implies heating of the ocean. Latent heat flux is associated with the phase change of water during evaporation or condensation and proportional to evaporation. Sensible heat flux is the rate at which heat is transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere by conduction and convection. In the tropics, latent heat flux is typically an order of magnitude greater than sensible heat flux, but in polar regions they are similar in magnitude. Downward shortwave at the surface is predominantly visible light. Upward shortwave flux is reflected sunlight, often determined by parameterization of surface albedo. While sensible, latent, and longwave heat fluxes occur at the sea surface, the shortwave radiation penetrates seawater and is absorbed with depth. These fluxes are major contributors to energy and moisture budgets, and are largely responsible for thermodynamic coupling of the ocean and atmosphere on all scales. Variability of these fluxes is in part related to largescale variability in weather (climate) patterns. For most regions, the two major components are the net shortwave gain by the ocean and the latent heat flux loss by the ocean.",

Because of technological advances in the last decade oxygen observations are poised to make the same breakthrough regarding frequency and depth of measurements that temperature and salinity observations made in this decade by utilizing profiling floats and other autonomous platforms. The implementation of a full-fledged observatory of oxygen in the ocean is critical to measure and understand the large (mostly) decreasing trends in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the ocean over the last few decades. These trends have important implications for our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Sub-surface oxygen concentrations in the ocean everywhere reflect a balance between supply through circulation and ventilation and consumption by respiratory processes, the absolute amount of oxygen in a given location is therefore very sensitive to changes in either process. Oceanic oxygen has therefore been proposed as a bellwether indicator of climate change. Moreover, a global ocean O2 observing network can improve the atmospheric oxygen to nitrogen ratio (O2/N2) constraint on the ocean-land-partitioning of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2). Annual cycles in oxygen concentration that are observed below the euphotic zone will also allow determination of the seasonal to interannual net remineralization rates as a proxy for export production.

		 "description": "The ocean is a major component of the global carbon cycle, exchanging massive quantities of carbon in natural cycles driven by the ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. Since seawater has a high capacity for absorbing carbon, the ocean also is a significant modulator of the rate of accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus slows the rate of global warming. The net carbon uptake of the ocean is approximately 25% of each year’s anthropogenic emissions. Due to the chemistry of carbon in water, this uptake is causing a decline in ocean pH, also known as ocean acidification. The ecological consequences of ocean acidification are a focus for much of the present research. Understanding current carbon uptake by the ocean is critical for understanding how the carbon cycle and climate are evolving under the impact of human activities, and the mechanistic understanding developed is needed in the interest of improved prediction of the state of the climate system. Understanding and predicting rates of ocean acidification are also fundamental to understanding the ocean’s biogeochemical evolution. The observations required to constrain the carbon system at a point in space and time are any two of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Total Alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and pH, and associated physical variables (temperature and salinity). The carbon system is in a delicate balance such that high quality observations will continue to be required.",

		 "description": "Transient tracers are a group of (chemical) compounds that can be used in the ocean to quantify ventilation, transit time distribution and transport time-scales. These compounds are all conservative in seawater, or have well-defined decay functions, and a well-established source function over time at the ocean surface. Measurement of transient tracers in the interior ocean thus provides information on the time-scales since the ocean was ventilated, i.e. in contact with the atmosphere. Knowledge of the transit time distribution (TTD) of a water-mass allows for inference of the concentrations or fates of other transient compounds, such as anthropogenic carbon or nitrous oxide. Commonly measured transient tracers are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 11 and 12, although in the past also CFC-113 and CCl4 have been measured. More recently also the related compound sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is regularly measured since it provides information on ventilation of the fast ventilated parts of the ocean. The radioactive isotopes 14C and tritium (that decays to the stable 3He) are commonly used, and have a natural decay time in addition to anthropogenic input during the 1950s. The tritium3He couple adds unique, additional information in that whereas the other transient tracers trace pathways into the ocean from the surface, tritiugenic3He traces the reverse pathway back out. That is, it is a nutrient-like tracer, being generated at a known rate by tritium decay and escaping to the surface ocean where it is “zeroed out” by gas exchange with the atmosphere. Although strictly not a transient tracer, since it is produced naturally by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, the argon isotope 39Ar has a half-life in the right order of magnitude to characterize global ocean ventilation and have an impeccable inertness. Difficult measurement techniques have hampered its use, but recently new technologies are emerging that might allow for a global survey of 39Ar in the near future.",

Below the euphotic zone, measurement of POM can provide information on organic matter export fluxes and rates of microbial respiration. Observation of POM within a global observing system would directly address the question of whether the ocean’s biomass and productivity are changing. Changes in POM could be important indicators of deteriorating water quality due to eutrophication in coastal regions, and of declines in primary production that could potentially translate up the food chain negatively impacting fisheries. Measurements of the inorganic fraction include Particulate Inorganic Carbon (PIC), which primarily represents calcareous shells of calcifying organisms, as well as biogenic silica (BSi). Observation of PIC would directly address the question of what impacts ocean acidification has on calcareous organisms and thus community structure. When combined with traditional ship-based measurements for calibration and validation POC, PON and PIC can be measured autonomously using bio-optical sensors and from space.",

		 "description": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important climate-relevant trace gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. In the troposphere it acts as a strong greenhouse gas and in the stratosphere it acts as an ozone depleting substance because it is the precursor of ozone depleting nitric oxide radicals. Because of the on-going decline of chlorofluorocarbons and the continuous increase of N2O in the atmosphere, the contributions of N2O to both the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion will be even more pronounced in the 21st century. The ocean - including its coastal areas such as continental shelves, estuaries and upwelling areas - is a major source of N2O and contributes about 30% to the atmospheric N2O budget. Oceanic N2O is mainly produced as a by-product during archaeal nitrification (i.e. ammonium oxidation to nitrate) whereas bacterial nitrification seems to be of minor importance as source of oceanic N2O. N2O occurs also as an intermediate during microbial denitrification (nitrate reduction via N2O to dinitrogen, N2). Nitrification is the dominating N2O production process, whereas denitrification contributes only 7-35% to the overall N2O water column budget in the ocean. The amount of N2O produced during both nitrification and denitrification strongly depends on the prevailing dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations and is significantly enhanced under low (i.e. suboxic) O2 conditions. N2O is usually not detectable in anoxic waters because of its reduction to N2 during denitrification. Thus, significantly enhanced N2O concentrations are generally found at oxic/suboxic or oxic/anoxic boundaries. The strong O2 sensitivity of N2O production is also observed in coastal characterised by seasonal shifts in the O2 regime. A biological source of N2O in the well-oxygenated mixed layer/euphotic zone seems to be unlikely. Global maps of N2O in the surface ocean show enhanced N2O anomalies (i.e. supersaturation of N2O) in equatorial upwelling regions as well as N2O anomalies close to zero (i.e. near equilibrium) in large parts of the open ocean. The MEMENTO (The MarinE MethanE and NiTrous Oxide database: https://memento.geomar.de) project has been launched with the aim to collect and archive N2O data sets and to provide actual fields of surface N2O for emission estimates.",

By observing the temporal development of the lightening of the oceanic inorganic carbon pool due to the uptake of CO2 originating from the burning of 13C-depleted fossil fuel carbon, a phenomenon also known as oceanic 13C Suess effect, an estimation of the anthropogenic carbon fraction of DIC is possible. Recent improvements in measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas dissolved in seawater using field portable spectrometers open up the possibility of underway 13C/12C observations across large portions of the surface ocean. Such data sets would substantially improve δ13Cbased estimates of organic matter (OM) export rate and of the air-sea 13CO2 flux. The latter term can be compared to depth-integrated 13CO2 inventory changes in the water column to provide a separation of anthropogenic CO2 change due to air-sea CO2 flux versus change due physical transport by ocean circulation. Recent application of this approach in the North Atlantic indicates that 50% of the anthropogenic CO2 increase in this ocean basin is a result of transport from the South Atlantic as part of the meridional overturning circulation.",

The size of the reservoir (comparable to that of atmospheric carbon dioxide), as well as its role as a sink for autotrophically fixed carbon, as a substrate to heterotrophic microbes, and as a sink/source of carbon involved in climate variations over long time scales, highlights its importance in the ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles. DOC is exported from the epipelagic zone at 1.9 Pg C yr-1, contributing 20% to the biological pump via meridional overturning circulation.",

		 "description": "The approach to measure and monitor phytoplankton and HAB EOV should include multiple observing tools in order to characterize the biological diversity of these organisms, their phenology, vertical distribution, and community composition, and their role in ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem services. The type of basic information required about these organisms, and recommendations for methods and best practices for data archive, is being documented by an operational Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON; Biodiversity Ad Hoc Group, 2010; Duffy et al., 2013; Muller-Karger et al., 2014). The measurements should collected routinely by operational and research programs such as by elements of the GOOS. These observations, including relevant environmental data, should be archived using guidelines established by OBIS for eventual facilitation of regional to global assessments. It is recognized that existing phytoplankton monitoring includes bulk measurements (e.g. pigments, size-based functional groups), target species (e.g. HABs), phytoplankton functional types, and full biodiversity measurements (species, genomics). Development of a standardized international effort that targets biological diversity should be the goal, with the understanding that characterization of phytoplankton at lower spatial and temporal resolution may be an operational necessity and remains valuable.",

In turn, zooplankton diversity is sensitive to environmental pressures such as climate change, including ocean acidification, warming and deoxygenation. The abundance and functional types of zooplankton, even their presence or absence, are accepted indicators of marine ecosystem responses to climate change. Ichthyoplankton surveys, focussing on larval fish species, can also be informative for zooplankton diversity.",

Both fish abundance and distribution can be reported at local, national, regional or global scales. There are two main sources of information on fish: fisheries data and scientific monitoring (fisheries-independent) data. Time series of fisheries data are more accessible and have broader geographic coverage when reported. Yet they only concern target species and stages of larger fisheries. However they may also include bycatch species collected through observer programs. Overall fisheries data can be biased as they highly depend on fishing effort and strategy.",

		"description": "Hard corals are the principal architects of coral reefs, supporting the high biodiversity and productivity of shallow, tropical coral reef systems. Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and highly valued ecosystems worldwide for their ecosystem goods and services. They are also one of the most threatened ecosystems of the world. Many people that depend on coral reefs live in low-income tropical countries. Healthy reefs are a foundation for their livelihood and food security; some products derived from coral reefs have global markets, including ornamental fish, cement, and tourism and recreation. Climate change, ocean acidification, fisheries, pollution, and coastal development are all significant threats to coral reefs. Hard corals are particularly vulnerable because they are slow-growing and susceptible to stress, particularly when there are synergies between natural and anthropogenic stresses. The health and areal extent of the hard coral community within a reef are direct indicators of the ability of a system to sustain the diversity of associated species, productivity, and valuable ecosystem services. Multiple measures give fundamental information on the health of a coral reef: live hard coral cover and the areal extent of a reef are the most important indicators of whether a reef is in a coral-dominated state or not; the composition and diversity of coral taxa is an important index of reef health; coral condition (e.g. bleaching, disease) gives fundamental information on the health of a reef; the size class structure (and recruitment) of hard corals gives fundamental information on the resilience, disturbance history and recovery potential of a reef.",

		"description": "Seagrasses are vascular plants that that can reproduce by flowering (sexually) and also spread asexually through rhizome extension. They can form dense, submerged meadows in coastal and estuarine waters. There are approximately 72 seagrass species that belong to four major groups. Seagrasses are often highly productive and provide essential habitat and nursery areas for many finfish, shellfish, charismatic megafauna, and species of concern, including sea turtles, dugongs and manatees. Seagrasses also help stabilize and protect coasts by binding underlying sediments. They contribute to good water quality by trapping sediment and absorbing nutrient runoff. Seagrasses are recognized as a “blue” carbon storage system, by fixing inorganic carbon via photosynthesis and storing and sequestering it in seagrass rhizomes and associated sediments. Although coastal vegetated habitats comprise only 0.2% of the world ocean they contribute >10% of all carbon buried annually in the sea. Vigorous photosynthesis by seagrasses can also reduce the acidity of surrounding water by removing dissolved carbon dioxide. Seagrasses are declining worldwide as a result of coastal development, nutrient loading that leads to poor light conditions on the sea floor, climate change, and cascading impacts of fishing. Loss of resources, including biological habitats such as seagrass meadows, is a major concern for governments worldwide and emerges as a major societal pressure motivating international conventions and bodies focused on ocean environment and resources. Regular monitoring of seagrass cover and ecosystem structure will be useful to modelling coastal and reef fishery production, the global carbon cycle, and tracking impacts of climate change and coastal eutrophication.",

The compounded effects of global and regional stressors are eroding the resilience of these systems, making regime shifts and population collapses more likely. Regime shifts such as the replacement of macroalgal canopies by less productive, low-diversity assemblages of turf-forming algae and barren habitat are increasingly observed on many reefs around the world. Vulnerability begets sensitivity and macroalgal forests respond quickly to deteriorating environmental conditions, potentially allowing the early detection of impending regime shifts. Furthermore, their broad distribution from boreal to temperate regions allows for comparison of latitudinal trends and the tracking of geographic shifts in species ranges. Macroalgal forests provide a sensitive and well understood indicator of changing coastal marine environments, and are also models for understanding more complex interactions influencing marine communities, building on the detailed experimental knowledge and basic ecological understanding accumulated for these systems over decades.",

		"description": "Mangroves are intertidal, tree-dominated wetlands distributed along tropical and subtropical coastlines and estuaries around the world.  Under the influence of ocean tides, these forests are periodically inundated with waters ranging from slightly brackish to hypersaline.  Trees in this environment must survive in dynamically flooded, anoxic, and saline soils, and the adaptations that they employ to tolerate the physiological challenges provided by these conditions distinguish the evolutionarily diverse mangrove plant taxa (McKee 1996; Scholander et al. 1962).  Mangroves mediate key biogeochemical fluxes (Kristensen et al. 2008), are highly productive (Bouillon et al. 2008), and support rich biological communities (Nagelkerken et al. 2008).  The functions performed by these ecosystems often translate into valuable services for humans.  They protect coastal communities from erosion and damage from storm surges (Das and Vincent 2009), filter terrestrial run-off (Ewel et al. 1998), supply timber, and generate significant revenue through ecotourism and biodiversity conservation (Costanza et al. 1997).  Mangroves provide critical nursery habitat for marine species around the world (Hutchinson et al. 2015).  This nursery function adds considerable value to coastal fisheries, with each hectare of fringe mangrove in the Gulf of California, Mexico, estimated to provide $37,500 (U.S.) per year in fisheries production (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008).  Globally, mangroves sequester and store more carbon than almost any other type of ecosystem (Donato et al. 2011).  Estimates of the total amount of carbon stored by mangroves range from 3 Pg C (Hutchinson et al. 2014) to 20 Pg C (by Donato et al.’s (2011) estimate of 1,000 tons C/ha).",

		"description": "The term ‘ocean colour’ broadly refers to the spectral radiance emanating from the sun that is backscattered off the upper part of the oceanic water column, and which contains information on the properties of the water and its constituents. The phenomenon of colour is the result of absorption and scattering, as light interacts with the water and materials suspended or dissolved within it (i.e., the optically active ‘constituents’). Ocean colour encompasses a multitude of biological, biogeochemical, and ecological properties of the ocean, and is an EOV because changes in the colour of the ocean can be related to changes in the presence and magnitude of living and non-living particles and of dissolved materials in the water. The measurement of ocean colour enables differentiation and classification of different water bodies because the colour of any particular ocean region depends on the proportion, type, and vertical distribution of different dissolved or particulate materials and the depth of the water. Ocean colour is useful for evaluating the health of an ecosystem and to inform resource management, such as fisheries and recreation, in the coastal and open ocean but also in lakes and other inland water bodies. It is also useful to estimate water quality and the amount of heat that accumulates as the ocean absorbs sunlight. In order to fully use the ocean’s optical properties to conduct broad ocean science and applications, it is critical for users to understand what type of waters are being observed, and also understand the limitations and possible errors in what are called ‘ocean colour products",

		"description": "Sound propagates so well in the ocean that it is the most effective way to probe the marine environment and communicate over long distances. Sound is critical for marine life and for seagoing humans. Most fish and invertebrates sense sound-induced particle movement; some fish and all mammals detect changes in sound pressure. Many marine animals produce sound, from the long-range, low-frequency calls of baleen whales and spawning fish to the intense high-frequency impulses of snapping shrimp and echolocation clicks of toothed whales. Acoustic cues are essential for larvae to settle in appropriate environments, for the mating systems of many fish and mammals, for predator-prey relationships, and for social species to maintain cohesion. This acoustic EOV will forge major advances in our understanding of ocean sound, how different sources of anthropogenic sound affect ocean ambient, the effects sound has on marine life, and how acoustic monitoring can be used to assess biodiversity and ecosystem health. We know that anthropogenic noise can harm marine life in the short term, but more extended observations are required to define long-term effects on populations and ecosystems. Understanding the effects of ocean noise as a stressor requires estimating how ocean sound has changed historically, requires mapping sound throughout the oceans on a global scale over decades, and requires predicting sound fields that result from changes in the use of the oceans. The largest anthropogenic changes in the acoustic environment of the ocean are associated with industrialized coastal regions and major shipping lanes.",

In 2009, it was recognized that the coordination of satellite data providers and pre-processing centres and provision of methodological guidance and advice for using the data would be necessary for a consistent and sustained system. An ad-hoc Planning Group was established after the 2009 GEO Plenary to develop a concept plan, which was followed by the more formal creation of a Global Forest Observations Initiative Task Force established by the 2010 GEO Plenary.",

This can be done in near-real time, or by use of archival tags in which the data are stored or later transmitted to an array of sensors or satellites.  Animal species tagged have ranged from 6-gram salmon smolts to 150-ton whales.  Detailed observations of animal movements and behavior in relation to critical habitats in their aquatic environment have significantly improved our understanding of ecosystem function and dynamics.  These observations are critical for sustaining populations, conserving biodiversity and developing the kinds of data required to implement ecosystem-based management.  Sensors carried by animals have recently come of age and deliver high resolution physical oceanographic data at relatively low costs.  Animals are particularly adept at helping scientists identify critical habitats, spawning locations, and important oceanographic features (e.g., fronts, eddies and upwelling areas).  They also provide important insights into regions of the oceans that are difficult and expensive to monitor (e.g., offshore environments, Arctic). ",

Kelp forests are ubiquitous along temperate coasts, covering 25% of the world’s coastline. Kelps themselves are a critically important species, forming the foundation of many temperate and boreal coastal ecosystems. Different aspects of global change that affect kelps can therefore have a large impact on the goods and services those ecosystems provide by rippling through the entire ecosystem. We seek to understand how these critical ecosystems may therefore be changed in the future, and to what extent they will be resistant and resilient to changes in our oceans.",

Through communication issues, selection criteria and activities, several other researchers and scientists became involved from public Agencies, Universities and research Institutes they spread information about the initiative and searched for suitable research sites. Favourable conditions for the start up of the Network were available thanks to the international Project ALTER-Net (A Long–Term Biodiversity, Ecosystem and Awareness Research Network; www.alter-net.info) and the National Forest Service – Conecofor Office (Corpo Forestale dello Stato – Ufficio Conecofor), the Italian partner of the project.

Its purpose is to support and strengthen the development of multinational engagement for sustained and coordinated pan-Arctic observing and data sharing systems that serve societal needs, particularly related to environmental, social, economic and cultural issues. SAON promotes the vision of well-defined observing networks that enable users to have access to free, open and high quality data that will realize pan-Arctic and global value-added services and provide societal benefits. Its goal is to enhance Arctic-wide observing activities by facilitating partnerships and synergies among existing observing and data networks (“building blocks”), and promoting sharing and synthesis of data and information. SAON also is committed to facilitating the inclusion of Arctic indigenous people in observing activities, in particular by promoting community-based monitoring (CBM) efforts. SAON is maintaining information about Arctic observational networks, projects, programs, and platforms",
